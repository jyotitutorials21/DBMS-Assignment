# Introduction(DBMS ASSIGNMENT)

This repository contains the practical implementation of fundamental Database Management System (DBMS) concepts using SQL.
The experiments focus on database creation, data manipulation, integrity constraints, and data retrieval using structured queries.

These labs provide a strong foundation in relational database design and SQL operations.

 Assignment_1: Database and Table Creation
 
# Objective
  To create database tables using SQL with appropriate data types and constraints.

📚 Concepts Covered

CREATE TABLE
Data Types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE)
Primary Key
Foreign Key

3.Implemented primary and foreign keys

Assignment_2: Data Insertion and Record Management
# Objective:-
To insert, update, and delete records using SQL commands.

📚 Concepts Covered
INSERT INTO
UPDATE
DELETE
WHERE Clause

____ Learning Outcome____

1. Learned how to insert records into tables
2. Modified existing data
3. Deleted records safely using conditions


ASSIGNMENT_3: Integrity Constraints
# Objective
To apply integrity constraints to maintain data consistency and accuracy.

📚 Concepts Covered
Primary Key
Foreign Key
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
CHECK Constraint

____ Learning Outcome____
1. Ensured entity integrity
2. Maintained referential integrity
3. Prevented invalid data entry


 ASSIGNMENT_4: Data Retrieval Using SQL (Read-Only Queries)
# Objective
To retrieve and analyze stored data using SELECT queries without modifying database content.

📚 Concepts Covered
SELECT statement
Column Alias (AS)
WHERE clause
ORDER BY
LIMIT
Derived/Computed Columns
Date Functions

____Learning Outcome____
1. Retrieved filtered data
2. Sorted records
3. Displayed limited results
4. Generated computed output
5. Extracted date-based information

📚 Conclusion

The completion of these laboratory experiments provided hands-on experience in SQL and relational database management.
The practical knowledge gained forms a strong foundation for advanced database topics such as joins, normalization, indexing, triggers, and stored procedures.
